#### Note: I mesaured a stage micrometer to see how many pixels equaled 0.1mm at each magnification.
I averaged 5 mesaurements of 0.1mm. (see excel file)
20x: 518.642
40x: 1031.232

This means that a photo with pixel dimensions of 2592x1728 (which is standard for all photos) has "real" dimensions of:

20x:
width == 0.4998
height == 0.3333
Total area == 0.1665 mm2

40x:
width == 0.2514
height == 0.1676
Total area == 0.0421 mm2
