# The original file is "all_isolate_...combined.txt:
The "rep1.txt" file was used for rep 1b because we didn't have all the isolate info at that point.

The inhib_to_include and nonInhib_to_include files are the isolates to use so that the pool we draw from are the same size.
I forgot to do this for rep 1 and rep2, so I'm doing from rep3 onwards.
