NOTE: pathways for all this code is not running. I moved the folders afterward and didn't try fixing the pathways, since they didn't really matter (they were all used to generate random sampling).

Thus, I just kept as-is. Other folders need to be executable to re-run things, but this folder is ACTUALLY what combos I used, so I don't want to mess with that.
