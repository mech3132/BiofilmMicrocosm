- jars 1,2,7,9 didn't have water in centre-- maybe something wrong with membranes?

- started at 11:15; finished 96-well plate around 12:30. Then, took until 2pm to mix cultures.

Put 1mL culture ein in 1.5mL centrifuge tube; spun down 2 min at 8000g and sucked off liquid. froze at -20 for DNA extractions later.

Put 1mL of mixed culture in each tube. In future, I should calculate "duplicate" jars together, so that I don't have to mix 2x the tubes. 4mL total of mixture, at a total of 0.1OD per tube (each isolate an equal fraction of total).

Fed 500uL and put in shaker at 88rpm, room temp.

Bd finally growing up nice in plates. have too many plates now, haha.


I fixed the code so you sum both reps of the jars together to mix, but I kept the OG version (_used.txt) for reference purposes

CV sampled
I forgot my laptop at home, so I re-randomized which jars got bd and which were sampled for CV.

- jars 2, 11, 9, 3, 7, 13, 5 --> exposed to Bd
- jars 1,4,6,8,10,12,14 --> sampled for biofilm

15 min methanol
5 min diH2O
15 min CV
rinse 2x diH2O
dry

Dropped 1mL of 5e6 zoospores directly on each membrane; both sides.

sampled pilot plate Bd; the methanol + rinsing doesn't remove a significant amount of Bd (or at least, I can still see them easily) but the pilot jars STILL don't have Bd. So I believe it's a density issue, and not a staining issue. Will need to figure out how to make denser Bd inoculant...
