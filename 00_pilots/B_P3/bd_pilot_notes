I autoclaved a jar with ~ 150 ml (not measured) spring water. Took 500uL of bd culture from each JEL and CAMP from both the 12/18 and 1/24 culture flasks
(I did this bc CAMP 1/24 didn't look very zoosporey).

Centrifuged down in 2 1.5mL tubes for 5 min at 4000g. Then did the second set of JEL/CAMP and centrifuged fro 5min at 4000g

Pipetted off most of the top, avoiding pellet. Took 1mL of spring water from jar and added to tubes, and vortexed.

Counted zoospores; about 30,000 per mL. 

Add 800uL zoospores to jar and 100uL zoospores to 15mL tube with straight-up 1% T in it (and a UV-sterilized filter)

Added 200uL 1%T to nutrient tube.

Placed in incubator/shaker at 60rpm at ~ 1:30pm. Will come back to feed on Sunday, probably, but only feed 100uL.

washed haemocytometer with 70% ethanol. Dumped trash in biohazard waste. Bleached excess superntatnt from BD cultures.

dipped in 1xPBS 3 times
dipped in stain (DAPI with PBS or CWF with PBS) for 20 minutes each
dipped in 1xPBS 3 times
dipped in deionized water 3 times

Added curing agent to some, but others not. CFW looks great in un-cured.
