I started 5 Bd plates on Tues, March 10th.
Also, started a culture of P. protegens in 1%T.

Grew for 2 days

on Thurs, Mar 12th, I inoculated 3 jars with P. protegens (500uL of culture each)
Then, I fed 100uL 1%T to all 8 jars 

The 8 jars are: 3 control (no bact), 3 wtih P protegens, and 2 where I didn't fill the inside tube first with liquid. it seems it doesn't matter; they filled up just fine. I'm treating them as extra controls to see if Bd settlement rate is any more... maybe I'll also use one or many of them as a treatment where I don't remove them from Bd jars after exposing to bd.

On 12 march, fed between 4:0pm-4:20pm.
However, school officially stopped classes on Friday, March 13th. So may need to stop at any point.

Want to also do a plate-test for different bacterial inhibitoary capcities using Bd plates-- will probably try to set up on Saturday or Sunday.

Fed as usual on Sat/Sun; on Sun, I fed late; around 8pm

-- 15mar2020

I fed at, like 8:30pm or so.

added 3mL of liquid to 5 plates of Bd. Got ~ 12mL of liquid off of all 6 plates.
Put 500uL of water on 12 plates; then 286mL in each jar (counted 15, 12, 16 per square on haemocytometer). 
Fed each jar 100uL.
Autoclaved old bacterial jars; leaving in autoclave overnight.

Going to let Bd plates dry in fume hood overnight and deal with tomorrow for spotting, since liquid is not drying fast enough.

Spotted plates. 
Fed 100uL to each jar.

---17 mar2020
Need to sample today. Labs closing tomorrow.

Put in 1mL 100% ice cold methanol (all membranes) for 20 min.
Rinsed in 500uL 1x PBS (all membranes) for 5 min.
Soaked in 1%CV OR 4:1 ratio PI + CFW for 10 minutes.
Rinsed in 500uL PBS (all membranes), 1 min
Then, soaked in 500uL DI for 5 minutes (all membranes).

Wells:all of column 4. Controls 
A-13
B-14
C-15
D-16
E-17
F-18
G-19
H-20

Turned on scope at 11:35am



** The inhibition assay is working already!!!

--> so I tried doing a plate test of growing Bd on a plate (with membranes) to see if I can see them after staining.
I THINK the issue might be that methanol fixation actually washes all the sporangia off... Which would explain a lot.
I'm thinking this is the problem because all the bacteria (which I'd plated underneath the membranes) fall off very easily after methanol fixation.
I had thought it wouldn't be a problem because the CV stain doesn't seem to be effected by the methanol fixation... but perhaps this is actually because the bacteria are more strongly adhered to the membrane? Perhaps I should non fix anything?

For my 3x pilot in the jars, I'm going to try staining directly with CFW, and CAREFULLY making sure that I don't wash off any zoo sporangia.
