re-doing "last" pilot

6 jars. They were sitting out for maybe 1 month, since bd got contaminated.

Now, I'm doing:
2 with bd only
2 with bd only, but the jar is going to be taken out and autoclaved
2 with bacteria + bd

--> going to try peeling off membrane and re-glueing a new one on
--> going to change water in one of them to see if that affects bd settlement
--> going to NOT methanol one set to see if it's the methanol that's killing the Bd...

using a mixture of 3 bacteria (20A, 25B, 13C)



Jar numbers:
13 bacteria
16 full time bd
17 bacteria
18 part time bd
19 full time bd
20 part time bd
--> changed plans on july 17th

Fed around 10:30.

Then went to autoclave some media, wash some tubes

-- 
fed between 11-12 each day; then added 10e6 zoospores on July 14th. Andrew counted; got something like 27.1 million/mL and added 369uL into each container.

andrew fed on wed around 11am; alex fed around 9am on thurs

On friday, I fed around 10am.
Sampled jar 20 to see if the bd were getting ready too early? Tried fixed and not fixed.

Sampled on sat
 did flexed 20minmethanol and non fixed-- both had none. I know the stain worked (12.5uM) because I tried smearing some plated Bd on a slide and it looked great. 
I think I might need to leave them in longer so that the Bd can really get going...??? Not sure.


Stained on July 20th... still nothing. Going to sample once more on the 23rd to see if any zoo sporangia appear. Next pilot I will feed more to see if I can get the Bd to grow faster.

Jars STILL not growing bd in them! Going to try:
- another plate-test; see if they will grow ON membranes, stain, then view
- Another tryptone test; grow them in 1%T and see if we can see them
- Drip Bd directly ONTO membranes; maybe they can't swim all the way up??
