notes 18feb 2020 about biofilm assay

-- for the first set inoculated wed 12; I simply too scoopes from the new plates and dipped thim in. harvesting on 18th.
- For second set inoculated on 15th, I dipped loop in liquid culture (inoculated by Alex a long time ago) and dipped in all 3 reps.

- first set is incomplete.
- second set is incomplete, but more complete.

For first set, plate 7 after row 4 is actually diH2o wash after CV bc I ran out
Second set is using non-sterile pbs x1 because everything is dirty anywa

Used same tips to suck out and deposit ALL stuff

-- suck out (200 setting)
- add 125ul pbs 
- remove 200ul
- add 125 cv
- remove 200ul
- add 200 pbs
- remove 200 pbs x2

then allow to dry (mostly bc I ran out of time today to read in plate reader.)

It is a DIRTY process. Need to autoclave all cultures, pbs, and CV bc all dirty. aerosols from pipette really bad.
NEED TO WEAR SAFETY EQUIPMENT BECAUSE THERE ARE DEFS PARTICLES IN AIR!!!!!

-- finished; took ~ 3h per set.
I ethanoled and bleached surface and pipette thoroughly.
Borrow 300uL pipette tips.
