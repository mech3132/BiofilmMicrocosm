none of the bd plates grew :( So I need to wait.

I did use some DILUTE Bd solution-- about 10,000zoospores/mL for the plate test, and about 100,000 for tub test
I didn't bother with the bead one beause there wasn't enough bd.

UGHHHHHHHH
Fed the tub one. 
Made 2 plates with stock 3, and added some tryptone
Made 3 plates with stock 1

I sampled the tub ones and 1 plate; the plate pos control (no back) was successful with lots of zoosporangia; visible on 20x but distinguishable on 40x.

The tub ones... not so much. Mind you, they were not as dense as the last set of plate ones (plated 17Aug2020, so zoosporangia would still be quite young)
I'm hoping that the last set of tub ones will work out... I'm going to set up another set in the next few days I think-- try to get as DENSE of a zoospore pop as possible.

However, the flask Bd is looking pretty good for now. Lots of zoospores.

The new plates I made on 15aug2020 also look good. They are not ready yet, no swimming zoospores.
If the plates are ready by tomorrow, then I am going to flood them and do one last tub test to sample (hopefully) on Sunday night.

-note- I did not do one on sunday night but did it on Monday
I got good zoospore counts, and poured 1mL into each well of a 12-well plate.
Then, after media cooled, I put 1mL of 1millionzoospores/mL into each and tested a bunch of different things:
- Clean membrane into liquid; but transferred out onto dry media after 24h
- Clean membrane into liquid; but kept in liquid for 3 days
- Dirty membrane (THICK biofilm) into liquid; but transferred out onto dry media after 24h
- Clean (but actually ended up contained) membrane on dry, but add 100uL zoospore solution.

- Also, did a plate test with this too. This pretty much failed because it became contaminated.

sampled everything
BEST result is leaving a membrane in a 12-well plate (with media) in 1mL of 1million zoospores/mL. Next best is if you move this membrane out after 24h and place it on a solid surface. It's actually not too different.

The bacterial membrane ones have WAY less zoospores-- not sure if it's because they wash off or not with the bacteria when we methanol things?

Not so great was adding 100uL directly onto membrane but I think this was actually because it got contaminated so the bacteria was pretty bad and prevented settlement.

There was also one that was in an infection tub and got transferred to a new jar (with glass beads)-- this actually worked really well. Not as good as the 12-well ones, but much better than anything I've tested yet.

Finally, there was one jus tin the infection tub the whole time. This had a TONNE of bacteria, and wasn't good at all. Barely any zoospores.

So I think the key is to not let the bacteria get to thick, otherwise we lose ALL nuance.

The jar ones were about a week old. I hope they were ripe by day 5...
